# shotspotter

special thanks to [Justice Tech Lab](http://justicetechlab.org/shotspotter-data/) for making their data publically availible.

Looked into the SF data specifically by **time of day** and **# of shots fired**.

General thoughts:
1. very cool that this technology exists, governance possiblilites could help save lives.
2. location of shots -- not in the entire city (might be because of technological limitations or user error when making graph)
3. As an SF resident I had no idea there were this many shots fired. -- *How can we better inform citizens about the realities that exist?*
